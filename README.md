# Time Series Analysis for Transportation

This project applies time series analysis to transportation-related data using Python. The primary objective is to explore trends, seasonality, and forecasting in flight activity and fuel prices. The project uses real-world datasets and common time series techniques to develop actionable insights.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with all analysis steps.
- `fuel_prices_2101.csv` — Dataset with historical fuel prices.
- `team_flights.csv` — Dataset containing flight data (team-specific).
- `CONFIG.JSON` — Configuration file for controlling aspects of the workflow.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: Main programming language used in this project
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Statsmodels**: Time series modeling (ARIMA, decomposition)

## 🔍 Key Topics Covered

- Time series visualization and rolling averages
- Decomposition into trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA)
- Interpretation of transportation data insights
